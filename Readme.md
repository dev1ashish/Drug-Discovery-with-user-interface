# Drug Discovery 

 This project leverages machine learning, data analysis, and web technologies to explore the potential of computational tools in drug discovery.

## Introduction

Drug discovery is a complex and time-consuming process that involves identifying compounds that can interact with biological targets to treat or prevent disease. This project leverages modern computational tools and techniques to streamline the drug discovery process.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on:

- Analyzing the ChEMBL dataset to identify patterns and correlations.
- Developing machine learning models to predict drug properties and interactions.
- Exploring the potential of data-driven approaches in drug discovery.
- Creating a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit for data visualization and interaction.
